# CONNECT 4

Create the game connect four. You have a similar example. [Here](https://solitariosonline.es/conecta-4)

## Requirements:

- 7x6 board (7 on the "x" axis and 6 on the "y" axis).
- Red and Yellow pieces. The first game is always started by Red (the second by Yellow, the third by Red...).
- There is no functionality to be implemented that allows you to play against the App. It is assumed that two real people will play alternately.
- Selecting the column places the token at the bottom.
- Save the number of games won by each team as long as the App is not terminated.
- Two buttons to restart the game in progress and to reset the win/loss counter.
- You can add as many extra features as you want.
